Krzysiek:
- caves in level generator
- simple enemy that hides in caves (aka some classes for handling AI and stuff)
- joining block horizontally
- faster collision detection
- fix assert error when hitting ceiling
- decide what to do with arrows stuck in the walls

Kuba:
- you made creating level take ages as you apparently compute a lot of stuff while I add blocks to the level.
Need to optimize this or make level save/load feature instead of generating each time. We need to discuss this.
- remove duplicates from "Unassigned" :P
- grass fix(krzysiek: not sure what you mean here but I see problems with missing grass when digging)
- darkness & light
- noninstant digging
- pile of * after digging
- carry pile
- pile process to resource
- ladder

Unassigned:
- item gathering
