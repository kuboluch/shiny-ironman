Krzysiek:
- caves in level generator
- simple enemy that hides in caves (aka some classes for handling AI and stuff)
- joining block horizontally
- faster collision detection
- fix assert error when hitting ceiling
- decide what to do with arrows stuck in the walls
- bug: it possible to put solid blocks on trees
- bug: it possible to remove solid blocks from under a tree

Kuba:
- building functionality - sawmill
- pile process to resource - wood in sawmill - global resource economy for now
- building ladder
- climbing ladder - just for fun
- crafting functionality - torches from wood
- viva la r√©volution (from global to regional economy) :)
- create simple demo world with mining, building & crafting for player only
    Resources: wood, stone, food
    Structures: hearth (spawn point, source of fire), sawmill, stonecutter, farm
    Items: hoe?, axe, hammer (with deassamble power), ladder (item or structure?), torch, arrows

...
- darkness & light (so late because it doesn't affect gameplay so much)

Unassigned:
- background blocks should be generated along with solid blocks
- background blocks item
- item gathering?
- item combining
- stone resource
- fighting rules - maybe more skill demanding gameplay like block with shield
