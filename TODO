9 bug: arrows loose their source when loading

Kuba:
- building ladder

    Resources: wood, stone, food
    Structures: hearth (spawn point, source of fire), sawmill, stonecutter, farm
    Items: hoe?, axe, hammer (with deassamble power), ladder (item or workplaceDefinition?), torch, arrows

...

Unassigned:
- background blocks should be generated along with solid blocks
- background blocks item
- item gathering?
