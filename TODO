Krzysiek:
1 caves in level generator
2 simple enemy that hides in caves (aka some classes for handling AI and stuff)
4 faster collision detection
5 Common collision pool with object types and collision rules, waiting for 4
6 decide what to do with arrows stuck in the walls
7 bug: it possible to put solid blocks on trees, waiting for 5
8 bug: it possible to remove solid blocks from under a tree
9 bug: arrows loose their source when loading

Kuba:
- building functionality - sawmill
- pile process to resource - wood in sawmill - global resource economy for now
- building ladder
- climbing ladder - just for fun
- crafting functionality - torches from wood
- viva la r√©volution (from global to regional economy) :)
- create simple demo world with mining, building & crafting for player only
    Resources: wood, stone, food
    Structures: hearth (spawn point, source of fire), sawmill, stonecutter, farm
    Items: hoe?, axe, hammer (with deassamble power), ladder (item or workplace?), torch, arrows

- pressing down should fill inventory even if currently selected slot is full
- I still feel that we shouldn't auto pickup small items. It will be more consistent if pressing up picks up those as well and pressing down is fast. We can leave auto pickup as an option
...
- darkness & light (so late because it doesn't affect gameplay so much)

Unassigned:
- background blocks should be generated along with solid blocks
- background blocks item
- item gathering?
- item combining
- stone resource
- fighting rules - maybe more skill demanding gameplay like block with shield
